How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel pretty confident (7/10) on my knowledge on Arratys so far.
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I'm interested in learning more array methods, and what they do.
What questions do you have about Arrays?
How many different array methods are there, and do they all do something totally different, or are there similarities to some?
